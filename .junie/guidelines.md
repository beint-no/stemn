* Hugo static site generator project
* Frontend frameworks: Tailwind and Bootstrap icons (not bootstrap) via CDN
* Do not use aria attributes
* for the frontmatter, only use the keys: 
title : Can be displayed on the page, for example as h1 of articles
seoTitle : only used in <title> tag
description: Only used in meta description, never rendred on page
summary: Like description, but meant to be shown on the page
layout: sometimes if the default page.html og section.html is not fitting our needs

* Blogs are always under /blogs
* Individual pages are always top-level without any extra folder

* Never include comments in code, code should be self-explanatory 

Guidelines for creating articles:

Use:

* Internal linking
* Tables
* SVG illustrations
* lists
* relevant bolding, italics, formatting

Also update other articles with internal links to the new article if relevant.

* When generating blog content, do not generate h1 title, as the title will be the h1
* Articles should internally link to other articles where it makes sense
* **Bold** important keywords for SEO in a natural way without overdoing it.
* Write well-structured markdown and double-check that valid markdown has been written.
  That includes newlines before lists with * so they are properly converted to lists.
* Always add illustrations as SVG files to articles.
  When creating SVGs, take extra care with width, height and placement so that
  text does not overlap; use math if necessary to calculate boundaries.
* When linking SVG illustrations in markdown, use only the filename (no path) must match 100 %.
* Use ASCII characters only in filenames, folders and URL handles (avoid å and ø).
* In SVG illustrations, escape &, < and other characters that need escaping.
* The article featured image can be generated by running
./generate_feature_image_svg.py 
from the blogs folder
